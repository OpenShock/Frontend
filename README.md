## Available Commands

- `npm i` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run preview` - Preview the built project
- `npx openapi-generator-cli generate` - Generate the API client

## Setup

To get started with development, you will need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

We recommend using a version manager like [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) to manage your Node.js versions.

### Install Node.js and npm

Install on Linux:
```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

Install on Windows:
```pwsh
winget install Volta.Volta
```

Then you can install the required **Node.js** and **npm** version by running a single command in the repository root directory:
```bash
volta install
```

### Install dependencies and build project

With Node.js installed, you can run the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

## Running locally

Running the frontend locally is as simple as this:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Hosts redirect

If you do not have a hosts file config for your domain and try to run the project you will get the following example message:
```
Please ensure that local.openshock.app resolves to 127.0.0.1 in your hosts file

On macOS and Linux, you can do this by running the following command:
echo "127.0.0.1 local.openshock.app" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

On Windows, you can do this by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:
Add-Content -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Value "127.0.0.1 local.openshock.app"

Then restart your development server
```

This action is required because of cookie policy, once you have done this you should be set!

Try closing and re-opening your development environment or console to refresh its cached system config.
